# Instructions  
## ***Count by Three from Start to Finish***


Write a count_by_three() function that takes in a start value and finish value and returns a string including every third number beginning with the start value and ending with the finish value.

Example: count_by_three(7,21) 
```
7 10 13 16 19
```

__________________________________
## ***Count Down***

Write a count_down() function that counts down from a start value to 1. The function should return a string containing a space between each number.

Example: count_down(6)
```
6 5 4 3 2 1
```

## ***Full Name***


Some people have just a first name and a last name. Some people also have a middle name. Some people have five middle names.

Write the full_name() that asks the user how many names they have. (If they have a first name, two middle names, and a last name, for example, they would type `4`.) Then, using a for loop, ask the user for each of their names. Finally, print their full name.
#### Example
Input:
```
How many names do you have? 3

Tell me your 1st name: David
Tell me your 2nd name: Anslem
Tell me your 3rd name: Yin
```
Output:
```
David Anslem Yin
```

**Hints:**

Instead of keeping a running total of integers, you are keeping a running total of strings!
- You can make a string variable that contains a string with zero characters like this. This is called the empty string.:
```
	my_string = ""
```
